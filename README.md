[Learn With Projects](http://learnwithprojects.fun/)

Learn with projects is a tutorial site, where you can learn to build project step by step by progressing through a completed project's git commits. Each commit will show you a diff from the previous commit and has comments on each commit to explain why those code changes were made.

On the backend, there should be a `repos` directory in the project's top level which holds the project repos. Each commit should have a file called `_teaching_notes.md` which will be displayed as the comments for that commit in the tutorial.
